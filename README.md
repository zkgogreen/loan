# about data
Is there any data on what a typical profile of people who apply for loans is, maybe its the case that teachers have knowledge or beliefs that prevent them from applying from loans (increased understanding of the impacts of debts, the understanding of compounding interest etc).

I appreciate some of the other statistics seem strange but without understanding firstly what types of people apply for loans and what living circumstances drive people to apply for loans and then also what factors would be processed when deciding if to use the particular providers that featured in this studys dataset its hard to draw statistics on who the people are and if that is truly representative of a typical population of loan applicants
